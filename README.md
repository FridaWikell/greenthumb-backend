## Introduction

This is the backend of the project GreenThumb Hub. You can find the frontend repository [here](https://github.com/FridaWikell/greenthumb-front).

The project is about creating a social media, a hub, for all gardeners. The purpose is to show other green fingered fellows how your garden is progressing, to ask for advice and questions or just have a fun time and find new friends with the same hobby as yourself.

## User Experience

### User Goals

The user goal is to be able to share the interest and hobby with other green fingered people. They should be able to communicate and learn from each others knowledge.

### Site Owner Goals

The site owner goal is to provide a place where the green fingers can grow and crack in bloom.

### User Stories

A total of five epics and eight user stories were created. To view all epics and user stories for the backend are collected at a project board [here](https://github.com/users/FridaWikell/projects/7).

All user stories are labeled with must have, should have, could have or won't have, depending on prioritization according to MoSCoW prioritization. Each of all user stories are also labeled with a point. The point is an estimate in how long time it will take to finish the acceptance criterias in the user story. All acceptance criterias are presented in each user story at the project board.

| Class | Points | Percentage of total points |
| ----------- | ------ | ------------ |
| Must have | 28 p | 64 % |
| Should have | 4 p | 9 % |
| Could have | 4 p | 9 % |
| Won't have | 8 p | 18 % |

#### [Epic - User authentication](https://github.com/users/FridaWikell/projects/7/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=60174807)

Given a user navigates to the login endpoint,  
When they submit correct username and password,  
Then the system should validate the credentials and issue an authentication token or session.

## Testing

### Validation of Code

All code files are validated in [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/#) to meet the PEP8 standards. All files got the "All clear, no errors found" except for the settings.py file. Four errors are left unfixed since the first of "AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS" wasn't under 79 characters, even if 'NAME' and 'django.contrib.auth.password_validation.UserAttributeSimilarityValidator' were on separate lines. The rest of the values in "AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS" were left unfixed to follow the same pattern as the first value pair. 

![Screenshot of "All clear, no errors found" result](doc/linter-all-clear.webp)

All code files (except settings.py) got "All clear, no errors found" message.

### Bugs

When all code files were validated in the Python Linter to meet PEP8 standards, just over 100 errors were discovered. The five most common were:

- No newline at end of file 
- Blank line contains whitespace
- Too many blank lines
- Expected 2 blank lines, found 1
- Line too long

The most common error was "Line too long".

These error were corrected and all files (except the settings file, see [Validation of Code](#validation-of-code)) resulted without any errors.

One known bug in the backend is in the answers pathway. You can't add a answer due to it doesn't have a question.id field in the test enviroment, which is required to submit the answer. This is solved in the frontend.

## Technologies Used

The repository is created from [Code Institutes Gitpod full template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) through [GitHub](https://github.com/). All code is written in [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) and deployed at [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com). The code language used is [Python](https://www.python.org/) with Django framework. To build RESTful APIs, Django REST is used. 

For the ERD's, [Google Spreadsheet](https://spreadsheets.google.com/) is used. To convert the screenshots to webp file format, [Pixelied](https://pixelied.com/convert/jpg-converter/jpg-to-webp) is used.

## Credits

The project is based at [drf-api from Code Institute](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/drf-api). The comments app, followers app, likes app, posts app, and profiles app are based but in some cases modified from the mentioned project above.

To get more knowledge, the [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/) and [Testing in Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/testing/) were used.
